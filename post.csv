Na T.,Toronto  Canada,41,9/25/2020,157,we so thoroughly enjoyed this place!! all the staff are so genuine & friendly. from the phone call i received to confirm my reservation. to the greetings upon our arrival. our server. carter was spectacular! he gave us great suggestions for some of the apps to start. i liked the team environment and efforts here. because even his colleagues came by to do regular table checks to ensure all guests are having a great time.the decore/ambience here is lovely! the theme is lots of botanicals & plants but oh do modern. even the staff wear floral & leafy tops! great extensive cocktail & wine list. food was spectacular! lots of tapas (small plates) to share so we were able to order:*shishito peppers 5/5nicely charred & grilled w.fresh lime & a tasty chive mayo!*churrasco oyster mushroom 5/5crispy bite to it and i loved the breadcrumbs & parm! definitely a mushroom lovers must try!*casava fries 5/5i loved the cook on this one! super soft & fluffy inside w.a crispy golden shell! please give this one a try! *roasted brussel sprouts 5/5great flavours used. coconut milk?! garlic aioli and lightly fried.*mushroom coxinha 4/5this little app comes with 2 pcs. a very crispy shell filled with porchini mushrooms & truffle mayo. i was expecting a more chunky filling of mushrooms tossed in a truffle mayo. it was more of a very creamy & heavy filling and the mushrooms were finely chopped or minced. overall still great flavours.*octopus tostada 5/52 pcs to an order. bite sized mini tacos w.slices of grilled octapus. avocado. jalapeno and a house salsa! *beef carpaccio 5/5thinly sliced beef. housemade casava chips. a bed of greens tossed in a creamy truffle crema and shaved pecorino cheese! *kale salad 4/5whole kale stems tossed in a green godess dressing. tiny croutons and cheese! loved this but i think if the kale was chopped its be easier to eat.*dessert - alfajores 5/5a rich chocolate cake dessert w.a creamy banana icecream! notes of caramel. hazelnut and a bit of seasalt. this dessert was heavenly! not too sweet (which i was afraid of) but it was more deliciously rich!overall food was absolutely delicious! service was stellar (thank you carter)!  im so looking forward to coming back and try everything else!
Michelle N.,Toronto  Canada,2,9/27/2020,56,Great South American resto right in the middle of downtown!The staff. the service and the ambiance is great. The staff were responsive. checking on us regularly and helpful with picking things from the menu. We ordered two pisco sours (one regular and one Marked special - both were amazing). We got the marked ceviche which was very flavourful. limey and very authentic. Also highly recommend.We ordered the Argentinian empanada. the chicken wings and the lambchetta. I would just recommend the chicken wings - spicy. very unique flavour and great presentation.The empanada was not well seasoned and the filling was a little watery. The lambchetta was alright but not worth the price and a little under seasoned. Though. I may say. the portion of lamb was good. The green sauce (pictured) seemed to be puréed avocado but it didn't add any flavour to the dish. Overall. I found it was an incomplete dish - missing a good sauce and seasoning.I would come back! But be mindful on the pricey side. I would come back for the drinks and wings!
Martin D.,Toronto  Canada,0,10/25/2020,7,We ate almost everything on the menu and every dish just got better and better!   Can't wait to go back and also enjoy the beautiful interior when able
David F.,Old Toronto  Toronto  Canada,223,10/10/2020,22,Very nice concept but falling a bit short in terms of execution.We came to this restaurant on a saturday night and sat on their patio. Patio was well decorated and cozy. Ordered three dishes: ceviche. flank steak and chicken wings.The ceviche was a standout dish and very nice. Well balanced overall and very authentic. The flanksteak was also well down other than the fact that they gave us a medium rare flank steak although we ordered medium.The wings on the otherhand were very over-cooked. They were terribly dry but had a nice crust on the outside from the flame grill. I was told the wings were cooked via sous-vide. Perhaps the wings were left too long in the sous vide bag or the wings were cooked too long on the grill.Food was decent I would say 4/5 stars. The service on the otherhand was nearly nonexistant. Service was very mediocore. server never checked up on us once and I had to make many attempts to get his attention just to pay our bill. Service I would say 2/5 stars with a lot of room for improvement! I definitely would try this place again and hope that it improves in the future as it is a relatively new restaurant.
Charron B.,Atlanta  GA,1,9/29/2020,1,I was very impressed by this place. The food. cocktails and service was good. The staff was helpful with suggestions. Went with a grouo of people and got seated in the patio. which was relaxing untill the knats came out.we were able to move inside and finished enjoying our evening. Will definitely be back. They jave a huge menu and i got to try more.
Elena A.,Old Toronto  Toronto  Canada,0,9/12/2020,1,This was by far the best service I've received in Toronto. Our server. Mark. was extremely knowledgeable and explained everything so well. He provided us with excellent recommendations and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant is breathtaking. A very cozy patio. Interior of the restaurant is a hidden gem. The food however is what makes this restaurant worth it. Bursting with flavour and high quality produce. Can't recommend enough.
